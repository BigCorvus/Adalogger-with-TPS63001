# Adalogger-with-TPS63001
The SAMD21-based feather adalogger with a different voltage regulator. It uses a TPS63001 synchronous buck boost chip to be able to use LiFePO4 batteries and still have a steady 3.3v. Another advantage is that more capacity can be squeezed out of LiPos, still maintaining a stable 3.3V rail.
